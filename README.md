# Random Message Generator: Inspiring Quotes

## Overview

This project is a **Node.js** application that generates random inspiring messages. Every time the program is run, it outputs a new message made up of three different elements: a quote, its author, and a category (e.g., motivation, inspiration, or success).

The goal is to provide users with fresh, randomized content to keep them inspired, motivated, or entertained each time the program is executed.

## Features

- **Random Message Generation**: Outputs a random combination of a quote, an author, and a category.
- **Dynamic Output**: Each output is unique, generated from a predefined list of data.
- **Expandable**: Can easily add more quotes, authors, or categories as needed.
- **Customization**: The project can be extended to include astrology readings, jokes, or custom messages.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/random-message-generator.git
   ```
````

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd random-message-generator
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

To run the program and generate a random quote:

```bash
node src/index.js
```

Each time you run the program, it will print a randomly generated message like the following example:

```
"Believe in yourself!" - Unknown [Motivation]
```

### Optional Arguments

You can pass a number to generate multiple quotes at once:

```bash
node src/index.js --count=3
```

## File Structure

```bash
message-generator/
│
├── src/
│   ├── index.js            # Main application logic
│   ├── messageService.js    # Logic for creating randomized messages
├── data/
│   └── messages.js         # Contains arrays of quotes, authors, categories
├── test/
│   └── messageService.test.js # Unit tests for message generation
├── package.json            # Node project configuration
└── README.md               # Project documentation
```

## How It Works

1. The application retrieves a random quote, author, and category from predefined arrays in `messages.js`.
2. The `generateRandomMessage` function in `messageService.js` combines these elements into a formatted message.
3. The result is logged to the terminal when the user runs the program using `node src/index.js`.

## Example Data Structure

The quotes, authors, and categories are stored in arrays, allowing for easy expansion. Example data structure in `messages.js`:

```javascript
const quotes = [
  "Believe in yourself!",
  "The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now.",
  "Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts."
];

const authors = [
  "Unknown",
  "Chinese Proverb",
  "Winston Churchill"
];

const categories = [
  "Motivation",
  "Inspiration",
  "Success"
];
```

## Future Improvements

- **Theme Support**: Allow users to choose different themes (e.g., humor, astrology, or business).
- **External API**: Fetch quotes from an external API like [Quotes API](https://zenquotes.io/) for more dynamic content.
- **CLI Enhancements**: Add more command-line options for further customization.

## Testing

Unit tests are provided to ensure that the message generation works as expected. To run the tests:

```bash
npm test
```
